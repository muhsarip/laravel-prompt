# 📋 Example Blog Feature Implementation

This directory contains a complete implementation of a Blog feature following the coding standards defined in `.rules/prompts.md`.

## 🎯 What's Included

### **Core Files**
- ✅ **Model**: `Blog.php` with proper relationships and fillable attributes
- ✅ **Controller**: `BlogController.php` with resource methods
- ✅ **Requests**: Separate validation classes for each action
- ✅ **Resource**: API resource for consistent responses
- ✅ **Policy**: Authorization rules for blog operations
- ✅ **Service**: Complex business logic in dedicated classes
- ✅ **Tests**: Complete endpoint coverage

### **Features Demonstrated**
- 🔐 **Policy-based authorization** in request classes
- 📊 **Spatie Query Builder** integration for filtering
- 📈 **Excel export** functionality with proper formatting
- 🧪 **Comprehensive testing** with proper assertions
- 📁 **Feature-based organization** with clear naming

## 🚀 How to Use This Example

1. **Study the structure** to understand the organization
2. **Copy the patterns** for your own features
3. **Adapt the examples** to your specific needs
4. **Use as reference** when creating AI prompts

## 🤖 AI Prompt Example

```
Create a Product feature similar to the Blog example in .examples/blog-feature/, but with these fields:
- name, description, price, category_id, user_id, status
- Include inventory management
- Add product image handling
- Follow the same patterns and structure
```

## 📚 Key Patterns Demonstrated

### **1. Request Validation**
- Each action has its own request class
- Authorization is handled in the request
- Clear validation rules with custom messages

### **2. Service Layer**
- Complex operations moved to service classes
- Single responsibility with `run()` method
- Proper dependency injection

### **3. API Resources**
- Consistent response formatting
- Conditional field inclusion
- Relationship handling

### **4. Testing Strategy**
- Feature tests for each endpoint
- Authorization testing
- Validation rule testing
- Edge case coverage
